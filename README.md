### What I learned

I met a very useful new method called `toggle`, which allows to tell the name of a CSS class and if it is active or not.

### Continued development

I continue to improve my learning about DOM manipulation.

### Useful resources

- [Desarrollo Web 6](https://desarrolloweb.com/faq/como-anadir-y-quitar-una-clase-css-de-un-elemento-mediante-javascript) - It was on this site that I discovered the method I used for this project.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList/toggle) - It helped me to better understand the toggle method.
